                      # JSON Tutorial #
            ---------------------------------------

# What is JSON ?  
    1. JSON - Java Script Object Notation
    2. JSON - It is a JavaScript object with some extra rules
    3. Parse:
             - It is one method of JavaScript 
             - parse means -> parse() OR JSON.parse() OR JSON.parse(string)
             - Here string is nothing but a JSON 
             - It means that string is converted into JavaScript object

# Why to use JSON ?
  - It is an alternative of XML
  - XML is quite diffcult
  - XML is not human readable
  - JSON is human readable as it is same as JavaScript

# Extension of JSON file is '.json' e.g 'file.json'

# We can integrate JSON with frontend very easily and effectively

# JSON is much better than XML in case of readability and useability

# JSON files are:
   - Very light weight 
   - very small size 
   - small size -> more readability
   - Easy to read 
   - Easy to use 

# JSON file symbol ->  {...}

# 'comments' are not allowed in JSON file

          #  Properties of JSON  #     
------------------------------------------------

1. It is Wriiten in curly braces like an object - { }
   - {....content.....}

2. In dobule qoutes and not single - " "  
   - "name"

3. Only colon and comma are allowed and not semicolon - ':' and ',' and not ';'
   -   {
          "name": "Suraj",
          "Id": 45
       }
   -  Last statement should not have any comma

4. We always write 'key-value' pair in JSON like an object
   - "key": "value" 
   - Example: "name": "Suraj"
   - Here name -> key & Suraj -> value

5. 'key' is always a string

6. 'value' can be anything 
   - i.e string,number,boolean,null,array,object,nested-object
         nested-array,object-inside-array,array-inside-Object
         boolean-inside-array, null-inside-array
   - We can make nested JSON means JSON inside JSON
     that is make object in your JSON       
   - You can go as deep as you want 


7. ERROR:
   - If key is like this -  isAdmin OR  'isAdmin' -> Error will occur
   - "isAdmin" -> is correct

8. To run JSON or JavaScript you can use:
   - browser console 
   - Node.Js

9. When we parse a JSON as a string into parse() method 
   then it will convert that string into JavaScript object
   - JSON.parse(string);
   - We get object - {....}
   - Example: 
             #  JSON =  {
                             "name": "Suraj",
                             "score": 14.45,
                             "isAdmin": true
                        }
             #  myJson = `JSON`
             #  myJson = `{
                             "name": "Suraj",
                             "score": 14.45,
                             "isAdmin": true
                           }`;  
             #  last semicolon is optional
             #  myJson is a variable of type string 
             #  myJson is actually a JSON that is converted into JavaScript object
             #  myJson is a string which we parse
             #  string = myJson
             #  Syntax - JSON.parse(myJson)
             #  We get object - { name: 'Suraj', score: 14.45, isAdmin: true }

 10. Tip:  'JSON' should be 'Simple' and 'Easy' to Read and understand...
